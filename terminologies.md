#### Dense subgraph mining

It is  finding vertices cohesively connected by internal edges. Dense subgraph notions have
been formalized as :  **clique, quasi-clique, k-core, ktruss, k-plex and k-club**.

Given a graph G, an edge cut is a set of edges Ec such that E(G) -Ec is disconnected.
- Min cut is the smallest set in all edge cuts
- The edge connectivity of G is the size of a minimum cut.

A graph is  dense if its edge connectiviety is no less than a specified minimum cut threshold.

---------------------


#### Contrast Subgraph  :

A contrast graph is a subgraph appearing in one class of subgraph and never in another class of graphs.

- Minimal if none of its subgraphs are contrast
- May be disconnected.


---------------------

#### Coherent Core in graph  :

A frequent substructure G is a coherent sub graph if the mutual information between G and each of its own sub graph is above some threshold. The coherent substructure mining selects a small subset of features that have high distinguishing power between different classes

---------------------
#### A scale-free network  :

 It is a connected graph or network with the property that the number of links originating from a given node exhibits a power law distribution 

In statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.

---------------------
#### A small-world network :

It is a type of mathematical graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but the neighbors of any given node are likely to be neighbors of each other and most nodes can be reached from every other node by a small number of hops or steps.



------------------
#### Random Graph:

In mathematics, random graph is the general term to refer to probability distributions over graphs. Random graphs may be described simply by a probability distribution, or by a random process which generates them. The theory of random graphs lies at the intersection between graph theory and probability theory.


---------------------
#### Regular Graph

In graph theory, a regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors; i.e. every vertex has the same degree or valency. A regular directed graph must also satisfy the stronger condition that the indegree and outdegree of each vertex are equal to each other.

------------------
#### Cycle Graph

In graph theory, a cycle graph or circular graph is a graph that consists of a single cycle, or in other words, some number of vertices connected in a closed chain.


An Eulerian cycle, ***Eulerian circuit*** or Euler tour in an undirected graph is a cycle that uses each edge exactly once. If such a cycle exists, the graph is called Eulerian or unicursal. The term "Eulerian graph" is also sometimes used in a weaker sense to denote a graph where every vertex has even degree.
